## Rathburn Online: Comprehensive Spreadsheet-style Data Explorer & Modular Query Builder

### Document Information
**Project:** Rathburn Online - Inventory Management System  
**Feature:** Comprehensive Spreadsheet-style Data Explorer & Modular Query Builder  
**Issue #:** 33  
**Author:** Conrad Thomson  
**Last Updated:** April 16, 2025  

---

## 1. Executive Summary

The Data Explorer feature will provide a comprehensive spreadsheet-style interface for exploring and manipulating data across the Rathburn Online system. It will include a modular query builder that enables non-technical users to create complex database queries through an intuitive drag-and-drop interface. This feature aims to empower users to gain deeper insights from their data without requiring SQL knowledge or developer intervention.

### 1.1 Business Objectives

- Reduce developer workload by enabling users to create their own data views and reports
- Improve decision-making through better data accessibility and visualization
- Increase user satisfaction by providing more flexible ways to interact with system data
- Streamline operations by allowing custom views of inventory, orders, and production data
- Reduce training costs by providing intuitive interfaces for data exploration

### 1.2 Success Metrics

- 80% of users can successfully create a custom view within 10 minutes of their first use
- 50% reduction in ad-hoc data export/report requests to the development team
- 90% of common data exploration tasks can be completed without leaving the Data Explorer
- User satisfaction score of 8/10 or higher for the Data Explorer feature

---

## 2. Background and Strategic Fit

The Rathburn Online system currently provides structured views for inventory management, orders, drum tracking, and production. However, users need more flexibility to explore relationships between data, create custom views, and perform ad-hoc analysis. The Data Explorer will complement existing features by providing unrestricted access to underlying data while maintaining appropriate security controls.

### 2.1 Current Limitations

- Users are limited to predefined views and reports
- Complex data analysis requires SQL knowledge or developer intervention
- Cross-table relationships are not easily explored
- Custom filtering and sorting options are limited
- Data exports require manual processing for further analysis

### 2.2 Strategic Alignment

This feature aligns with the overall system goals by:
- Supporting data-driven decision making
- Promoting user autonomy and reducing IT dependency
- Building on the existing foundation of inventory management
- Providing a platform for future analytical capabilities
