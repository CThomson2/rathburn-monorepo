## Feature Implementation Summary: Mobile Stocktake Scanning Workflow

**Goal:** To implement a robust system allowing warehouse staff to perform physical stock takes using the Vite PWA on Honeywell mobile computers. Scans are captured via keyboard wedge, processed, stored in the database, and broadcast via Server-Sent Events (SSE) to enable future real-time dashboards.

**Implementation Details:**

**1. Mobile App (Vite PWA - `apps/mobile`)**

- **Scan Input (`ScanInput.tsx`):** A globally persistent, hidden input field captures keyboard wedge scans across all views. Its activation (`isActive` prop) is now strictly controlled based on whether a stocktake session is active in the central state. Significant effort was made to ensure reliable focus management for this component.
- **State Management (`useStockTake.ts`):** This custom hook centralizes the state and logic for stocktake operations.
  - Manages `currentSessionId`, scan processing status (`isScanning`), and feedback (`lastScanStatus`, `lastScanMessage`).
  - `startStocktakeSession`: Now initiates a session by calling a dedicated backend API (`/api/scanner/sessions/start`) and stores the backend-generated session UUID in state.
  - `processStocktakeScan`: Triggered by the global scan handler, it fetches the _current_ Supabase auth token (`getSession().access_token`), verifies an active session ID exists, and calls the backend scan processing service (`handleStockTakeScan`).
  - `endStocktakeSession`: Currently updates local state to clear the `currentSessionId`. _(See Outstanding Issues)_.
- **UI (`StockTakeDrawer.tsx` & `Index.tsx`):**
  - The UI for managing sessions (start/end buttons, status display) was moved from a separate view into a reusable `StockTakeDrawer.tsx` component (using Shadcn `Sheet`).
  - This drawer is rendered within the main `Index.tsx` page.
  - `Index.tsx` now manages the drawer's visibility state (`isStockTakeDrawerOpen`) and passes necessary state (`currentSessionId`, `isScanning`, etc.) and callbacks (`startStocktakeSession`, `endStocktakeSession`) from the `useStockTake` hook down to the `StockTakeDrawer` as props.
  - A toggle button was added to the `TopNavbar.tsx` component (via the `extraActions` prop) to open the `StockTakeDrawer`.
  - The `handleGlobalScan` function in `Index.tsx` routes scans: if a stocktake session is active, it calls `stockTake.processStocktakeScan`; otherwise, it delegates to other handlers (like `transportScan.handleDrumScan`) or ignores the scan.
- **API Service (`stockTakeScan.ts`):** A dedicated service function `handleStockTakeScan` makes the authenticated `POST` request to the `/api/scanner/stocktake/scan` endpoint, passing the barcode, session ID, device ID, and Bearer token.
- **Authentication (`useStockTake.ts` Fix):** Resolved a critical bug where the hook wasn't reliably getting the auth token. It now directly calls `supabase.auth.getSession()` within `processStocktakeScan` and `startStocktakeSession` to ensure the current token is used for API calls.

**2. Backend (Next.js - `apps/web`)**

- **Session Start API (`/api/scanner/sessions/start`):**
  - A new `POST` endpoint was created.
  - Authenticates the request using the Bearer token.
  - Inserts a new record into `public.stocktake_sessions` with a generated name and the authenticated user's ID.
  - Returns the newly created session details (including the essential `id`) with a `201 Created` status.
- **Scan Processing API (`/api/scanner/stocktake/scan`):**
  - Authenticates requests using the Bearer token from the `Authorization` header.
  - Receives `barcode`, `sessionId` (now a valid UUID from the `/start` endpoint), and `deviceId`.
  - **Barcode Identification:** Calls the new database RPC function `find_item_by_barcode_prefix` to efficiently determine if the 10-character `barcode` corresponds to a material or supplier UUID prefix.
  - **Database Insertion:** Inserts a record into `logs.stocktake_scans`, including the identified `barcode_type`, `material_id` or `supplier_id`, and the validated `stocktake_session_id`.
  - **SSE Broadcasting:** If the scan is successfully recorded, it calls `broadcastScanEvent` from `@/lib/events/sse.ts`, sending a structured `StocktakeScanEvent` payload.
- **SSE Infrastructure (`sse.ts`, `/api/scanner/stocktake/events`):**
  - The core library (`sse.ts`) manages connected SSE clients (`ReadableStreamDefaultController`) and provides `broadcastScanEvent`. Type safety was improved.
  - The `/api/scanner/stocktake/events` route establishes SSE connections, registers clients with `sse.ts`, and handles client disconnections.

**3. Database (Supabase)**

- **Schema (`..._create_stocktake_schema.sql`):**
  - `public.stocktake_sessions`: Stores session metadata. RLS policies added.
  - `logs.stocktake_scans`: Logs individual scan events with FK to `stocktake_sessions`, `users`, `devices`, `materials`, `suppliers`. RLS policies added.
  - `public.stocktake_material_counts`: A materialized view providing aggregated counts per material per session.
  - `refresh_stocktake_material_counts()`: Trigger function (now using `SECURITY DEFINER`) to refresh the view.
  - `refresh_stocktake_counts_trigger`: Trigger on `logs.stocktake_scans` calling the refresh function.
  - `stocktake_material_counts_unique_idx`: Added the required `UNIQUE INDEX` on the materialized view to allow `REFRESH CONCURRENTLY`.
- **RPC Function (`..._add_find_item_by_barcode_prefix_rpc.sql`):**
  - `find_item_by_barcode_prefix(p_barcode_prefix TEXT)`: Efficiently searches `inventory.materials` and `inventory.suppliers` using `LIKE` on text-casted UUIDs to find matches for the 10-char barcode prefix.

**Key Challenges Addressed:**

- Resolved complex `ScanInput` focus issues by centralizing state and simplifying the UI structure (moving to Drawer).
- Fixed Bearer token authentication flow for API calls from the mobile app.
- Correctly implemented partial UUID matching using an RPC function instead of direct table filtering errors.
- Resolved PostgreSQL permission (`SECURITY DEFINER`) and materialized view refresh (`UNIQUE INDEX`, `CONCURRENTLY`) errors.
- Corrected invalid hook calls in the toast system.

**Real-time Foundation:** The system now successfully captures scans, persists them, and broadcasts SSE events upon successful insertion. This completes the necessary backend and mobile app work to support the real-time analytics dashboard feature.

**Outstanding Mobile App Issues to Address:**

1.  **Toast Functionality:** The toast notifications are currently not displaying, likely due to fixes implemented for React hook errors that may have inadvertently disabled the rendering part (`Toaster` component or its connection). This needs investigation and reinstatement to provide essential user feedback on session starts, scan success, and scan errors.
2.  **Session Status Indicator:** The main `Index.tsx` view lacks a clear, persistent visual indicator (e.g., a status dot) to show the user if a stocktake session is currently active in the background, regardless of whether the `StockTakeDrawer` is open.
3.  **Session End Persistence:** The `endStocktakeSession` function in `useStockTake.ts` currently only clears the session ID in the local app state. It does _not_ update the corresponding session record's `status` to 'completed' or 'cancelled' in the `public.stocktake_sessions` database table. An API call needs to be added to persist this change.

This summary covers the implemented workflow and known remaining issues. The next logical step is to build the Next.js page and components for the real-time analytics dashboard, consuming the SSE events broadcast by the backend.
