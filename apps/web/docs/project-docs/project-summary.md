# MCP Integration Project for Manufacturing Operations Platform

## Project Overview

A structured exploration of Model Context Protocol (MCP) servers to enhance the development workflow of a Next.js-based manufacturing operations platform. The project aims to leverage various MCP servers to improve development efficiency, maintainability, and user experience while building a complex enterprise application for non-technical manufacturing staff.

## Core Application Context

Enterprise-grade Next.js application focusing on:

- Inventory management
- Production tracking
- Real-time collaboration
- Data-driven dashboards
- Role-based access control
- Document generation and reporting

## MCP Integration Workflows

### 1. UI/UX Development Stream

**Primary Challenge:** Creating intuitive interfaces for technology-resistant users
**Key MCP Servers:**

- **Figma MCP** - Main driver for UI implementation using Shadcn UI components
- **Sequential Thinking** - For user flow optimization and interaction design
- **Memory** - To maintain consistent design patterns across the application

### 2. Data Layer & Server-Side Operations

**Primary Challenge:** Complex data relationships and real-time operations
**Key MCP Servers:**

- **Supabase MCP** - Database operations and real-time subscriptions
- **PostgreSQL MCP** - For complex query optimization and schema design
- **Redis MCP** - Caching and real-time features

### 3. Development Operations & Tooling

**Global MCP Servers** (Used across all workflows):

- **GitHub MCP** - Version control and project management
- **Filesystem MCP** - Local development and file operations
- **Memory MCP** - Knowledge persistence across development sessions
- **Sequential Thinking MCP** - Complex problem-solving and architecture decisions

### 4. Supporting Systems

While not directly MCP-related, these aspects inform our MCP server choices:

- Communication system architecture
- Authentication and authorization flows
- Report generation and email automation
- DevOps and deployment pipelines

## Project Goals

1. Establish optimal MCP server combinations for different development tasks
2. Create reusable patterns for MCP server integration
3. Develop custom MCP servers for manufacturing-specific needs
4. Document best practices for MCP usage in enterprise Next.js applications

## Technical Foundation

- Next.js 14 App Router
- TypeScript
- Shadcn UI
- Supabase
- TanStack Query
- Tailwind CSS

## Special Considerations

- Focus on user adoption for technology-resistant staff
- Real-time collaboration requirements
- Data integrity in manufacturing context
- Audit trail and reporting requirements
- Performance optimization for data-heavy operations

This project serves as both a practical implementation of MCP servers in a production environment and a learning journey into MCP capabilities and patterns. The insights gained will inform future development practices and potentially contribute to the broader MCP ecosystem.
