# Progress Summary: Issue #29 - Enhance DB Schema: Implement `stock_activity` table

## Steps Completed

1. Created a new GitHub feature branch for database prototyping and pushed to remote
2. Completed the replacement of raw materials for red materials code
3. Started setting up the Supabase environment for database schema work
4. Added necessary certificates to resolve TLS certificate issues
5. Verified MCP server configuration for seamless integration with Supabase

## Next Steps

1. Copy/migrate the database schema structure from Supabase 'main' branch to the new feature branch
2. Using Supabase branching, switch to the newly created branch
3. Continue with the data processing tasks:
   - Select stock history rows missing quantity from event string
   - Update materials to match reference table
   - Match suppliers where applicable
   - Split multi-material events into individual rows
   - Replace data in drum type column based on material_name
   - Rename table to stock_control

## Overall Progress

The initial setup phase is nearly complete. We've established the necessary environment for working on the database schema enhancements. The focus now shifts to implementing the actual schema changes and data processing logic for the `stock_activity` table, which will eventually be renamed to `stock_control` and serve as the live operational table for stock management.
