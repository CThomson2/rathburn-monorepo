# Issue 33 - Spreadsheet UI & Modular Query Builder

## Planning Overview

The overarching goal is to provide a flexible “build your own table” experience—similar in feel to Excel—without overwhelming people who are not at all interested in writing SQL. I’ve broken it down into two parts: **(A) Database-layer changes** and **(B) Frontend / Next.js approach**.

---

## A) Database-Layer Changes

### 1. Dedicated “UI” or “Views” Schema
- **Why?**  
  Creating a separate schema (e.g., `public_views` or something similar) helps you organize user-friendly, read-only representations of your existing tables without cluttering the main `public` schema with a million new tables or artifacts.
- **Naming Conventions**  
  - Use clear, descriptive names that match the business or spreadsheet context (e.g. `vw_supplier_inventory`, `vw_production_runs`, etc.).
  - Possibly mirror the names of existing Excel sheets your colleagues currently use. That way, they see a direct correlation when they open the Supabase dashboard.
- **Benefits**  
  1. Reduces confusion: Non-technical staff in Supabase see only the curated set of views, not the underlying raw tables.  
  2. Allows you to rename fields (using aliases) to make them more user-friendly (e.g., `SELECT col_internal_name AS "Material Name"`).
  3. Potentially encapsulates joins or transformations. For example, if you commonly join `orders` with `customers`, a view can handle that so your end users see the combined data in one place.

### 2. Materialized Views vs. Standard Views
- **Standard Views** are simpler to set up, update in real-time, and are typically fine for small or moderate data sets.  
- **Materialized Views** can help if you have complex joins/aggregations that need better performance, but they require manual or scheduled refresh.  
- Start with simple views—materialized views can come later if performance or concurrency becomes an issue.

### 3. Potential Database Functions
- **Read-Only Functions**: If you find yourself needing dynamic parameters from users (e.g., “show me everything from last week with status = X”), you could implement Postgres or Supabase RPC (remote procedure calls) to abstract complex queries.  
- **Naming & Documentation**: Just like your views, keep function names descriptive and references easy to read.

## B) Frontend / Next.js Approach

### 1. “Build Your Own Table” Concept

You’re basically describing a mini “low-code BI” or “data explorer” tool. The biggest challenge is balancing:
1. **Simplicity**: People don’t get overwhelmed.  
2. **Flexibility**: You don’t have to build endless custom pages for every request.

Below are strategies to keep it approachable while still offering powerful capabilities.

---

#### 1. UI Library & Table Components

- **Use a Headless Table Library** (e.g., [TanStack Table](https://tanstack.com/table/v8) or “React Table”) so you can handle advanced features like sorting, filtering, column show/hide, grouping, and pagination without reinventing the wheel.
- **Grid or Spreadsheet-Like Components**: If you truly want Excel-like interactions (dragging columns, inline editing, etc.), consider a library such as [AG Grid](https://www.ag-grid.com/) or [Grid.js](https://gridjs.io/). But these can be complex for novices; ensure you only expose the simplest features by default.

---

#### 2. Progressive Disclosure of Complexity

- **Default Mode**: Make the table appear with a minimal set of columns (just like an Excel sheet with 5–10 key columns). Sorting, searching, and basic filtering should be one click away, with easily recognizable icons (like a funnel icon for filters).
- **“Advanced” or “Custom Query” Tab**: Let power users or managers expand to see advanced settings. This could allow them to add columns from a second or third table (like a “Join” in the background). If they find it too confusing, they can simply stay in the default view.
- **Hide Unnecessary Settings** by default. Only show more advanced filters if a user specifically clicks “Add advanced filter.” This keeps the interface from scaring them off at first glance.

---

#### 3. Building the “Configuration” UI
- **Drag-and-Drop or Checkboxes** for columns:
  - Show a list of all possible columns (or fields from related tables). Users can check or uncheck the fields they want to see.
  - Simple text-based search for “which column do you want to add?” (like Excel’s “choose columns”).
- **Filtering & Sorting**:
  - Keep it straightforward: a filter row that appears under the column headers. Or a simple side panel that says “Filter by X” with a dropdown for conditions (`=`, `<`, `>`, etc.).
- **User Preferences**:
  - If you store each user’s chosen columns/filters in a table (e.g., `user_preferences`), they won’t need to re-select the same columns every time. This fosters a sense of ownership over the tool.
- **Safety Net**:
  - Provide an easy “Reset to Default” so they can revert to the original layout if they accidentally hide everything or add weird filters.

#### 4. Iteration vs. “One Big Reveal”

You mentioned wanting to avoid iteration after iteration, but ironically, user feedback is key for data presentation tools. It’s almost impossible to guess the perfect UX for your colleagues—especially if they themselves are unsure. A few pointers:

1. **Quick, Early Demo**: Even if your “build your own table” feature is only 30% done, let them see it. They might say “Yes, this is good enough,” or “We actually don’t need half these columns.” That’s valuable feedback to shape the rest of your build.
2. **Use Familiar Excel Terminology**: Label your features with the same words used in Excel (e.g., “Sort Ascending” instead of “Order by ascending,” or “Filter by value” instead of “Set predicate condition”).
3. **Educate Gently**: Provide tooltips or short instructions. If they see a new concept like “Join other table,” a 1–2 line explanation might help them connect it to “VLOOKUP” or “Pivot Table” from Excel.

---

#### 5. Security & Access

- **Row-Level Security or Table Permissions**: In Supabase, you can gate certain tables or columns so only certain roles see them. This helps if the data explorer is quite powerful but you don’t want certain employees seeing all fields.
- **Read-Only vs. Editable**: Decide whether this “build your own table” interface should allow any writes or updates. Often, these advanced data explorer views are read-only, with specialized forms for updates to protect data integrity.

---

## Putting It All Together
1. **Create a “UI” or “Views” schema** with a set of read-only views that are easily recognized by your end users and match the columns/names used in your spreadsheets.
2. **Use a robust table library in Next.js** to replicate Excel-like functionality: sorting, filtering, hiding columns, grouping, etc.
3. **Aim for minimal friction**: “Check a box to add a column,” “Click a funnel icon to filter,” and “Drag to reorder columns” are all fairly intuitive to Excel users.
4. **Hide advanced features** behind an “Advanced” tab or something that novices can ignore.
5. **Iterate lightly**: Don’t overcomplicate. Show your colleagues a rough initial version so they can guide which features matter and which are unneeded.

### Final Thoughts

Even though it’s tempting to “perfect” the system in one big pass, building any kind of flexible data explorer is notoriously tricky—especially for non-technical people. The key to success is to leverage existing patterns they know (like Excel) while quietly introducing new possibilities in a non-intimidating way. By focusing on clarity, progressive disclosure of advanced features, and user feedback, you’ll strike the right balance between power and simplicity.
