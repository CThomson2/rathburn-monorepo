# Issue: #36 - Automated Data Pipeline: Excel Material Inventory Processing

## Overview

Create a scheduled data processing pipeline to automatically extract, clean, validate, and import material inventory data from
Excel files into our database system.

## Priority

Medium - Important for operational efficiency but not blocking current functionality

## Tags

- Automation
- DevOps
- Data Processing

## Problem Statement

We currently have a manual process for importing material inventory data from Excel files (format: "H17600-99.xlsx"). These
files:

- Are created sequentially (each with 100 records)
- Have consistent structure but contain human data entry errors
- Require cleaning and validation before database import
- Need regular processing without excessive overhead

## Requirements

### Functional Requirements

1. Automatically identify the most recent Excel file based on filename pattern
2. Parse and extract tabular data from the Excel file
3. Clean common errors:

- Date formatting issues (e.g., "12/03/2025.")
- Material name inconsistencies (e.g., "PERC" vs "TCE" vs "Perchloroethylene")

4. Implement confidence scoring for data validation
5. Import high-confidence data automatically
6. Flag low-confidence data for manual review
7. Generate processing reports

### Technical Requirements

1. Scheduled execution (daily or configurable interval)
2. Logging of all processing activities
3. Email notifications for flagged data and processing status
4. Configurability of confidence thresholds
5. Error handling and retry logic

## Proposed Solution

### A Python-based data processing pipeline using:

- Pandas for data manipulation
- Fuzzy string matching for material name standardization
- Regular expressions for data cleaning
- Cloud scheduler for regular execution
- Database connection for importing processed data

### Implementation Plan

1. Develop and test the processing script locally
2. Set up cloud infrastructure (serverless function or VM)
3. Configure scheduling and monitoring
4. Implement reporting and notification system
5. Deploy with logging and error handling

## Future Related Tasks

### Barcode Scanner Integration Pipeline

- Develop server-side script to receive and process barcode scans
- Create validation and routing logic for scan data
- Implement database update procedures via API routes
- Set up notification triggers in Supabase public.notification table
- Configure conditional notification delivery (in-app vs email)
- Implement SMTP integration for email notifications
- Add error handling and retry mechanisms

### Notification System Enhancement

- Create configurable notification rules in admin interface
- Implement priority levels for different notification types
- Add support for notification templates with variable substitution
- Develop notification aggregation to prevent alert fatigue
- Set up notification acknowledgment tracking

### Data Quality Monitoring System

- Implement automated data quality checks across systems
- Create dashboards for data quality metrics
- Set up alerting for significant data quality issues
- Develop self-healing processes for common data problems

### Acceptance Criteria

- Pipeline successfully identifies and processes the latest Excel file
- Data cleaning achieves >95% accuracy for common errors
- Confidence scoring correctly identifies problematic entries
- Clean data is properly imported into the database
- Low-confidence entries are flagged and reported
- Process runs according to schedule without manual intervention
- Complete logging and reporting is available for auditing
