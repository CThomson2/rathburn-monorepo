## Daily Summary Email

> At the end of each workday, at a sensible time, program Supabase to send out an auto-generated email to participants (managers, director, relevant workers).

The email will contain:

1. Initial high-level daily stats on production, e.g:
   "_Wrapping up another day with your live production report. 9 distillations took place today. 7 were processed and tested, meeting all specifications. One fell behind the timeline and will continue tomorrow. The isohexane process fell short of spec, resulting in a reprocess pushed onto tomorrow's schedule._

2. Still record highlights:
   "

- A: **Acetonitrile HPLC 28C25FA - 156LT. - OS Flammables 1**
- ...
- M: **Methanol GD 28C25NB - 98LT. - Amenities**
- ...
- T: **Toluene - Repro R3014 - GC 99.21%**
  "

3. Generated graphs and data visualisations of today's processes and stock control in/out movements
4. Comparative data points/graphs showing trends over time
5. Outline of following day's production schedule
6. Random, unique fact or quip on topics like chemistry, business, current affairs, local news, holidays etc. (bit of levity to end it off)
7. Sign off, with a reply-to email link should anyone want more info

No "cheery" or "jokey" tone, as this will get old and stale fast. Professional and succinct email. Look into changing the SMTP address for something impersonal (operations@rathburn.app, _themethylethyltimes@rathburn.app_.
