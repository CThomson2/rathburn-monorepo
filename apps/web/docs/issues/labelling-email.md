It all comes down to the current lack of standardisation. As we’re all aware, we do not have a system for universal naming, for data formatting, or handling data errors when working with the stock sheets.

If we had maintained accurate records, it would be painless to map old IDs to new (although we also wouldn't be in such need of a new system). After working with the Goods Inwards and Stock-Control audit logs for hours on end, it’s unfortunately become clear that this data is effectively useless for anything other than recording deliveries and processes as they happen. It cannot be used to report or analyse data after the fact.

Our drum stock contains around 600 drums. This doesn't mean 600 unique drums. Any raw drum with a given (material, supplier) combination is completely identical to any other with the same combination, for business purposes (as James made it clear last week in the office).

Given

It’s inadvertently misleading,

There's something like 50-75 of these batched groups in stock. When doing my manual stock count, many drums didn't have labels yet, and others weren't all visible. So, for these I just took down the supplier batch code and found it in the spreadsheets.

As you're probably aware, the spreadsheet system isn't exactly a 100% trustworthy basis, given the huge discrepancies just since the winter. Often the wrong drum row in an H1xx00-99 sheet is marked as processed.

If we had maintained accurate records it would be painless to map old IDs to new (although we also wouldn't be in such need of a new system).

Because there are thousands of rows going back years, the only way to map old data to new is by writing a program to sift through it all. Problem is, I can't just tell a computer code about every error and how to handle it. Or tell it every
