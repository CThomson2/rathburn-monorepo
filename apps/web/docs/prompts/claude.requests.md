## Issue #33

Please review the GitHub issue number \"#33\" in my repository for this codebase named (rathburn-online); the issue is named \"Comprehensive Spreadsheet-style Data Explorer & Modular Query Builder\". You will be working on the feature 'data-explorer', which you can find the code for in \"/src/features/data-explorer\". The code is in development as I just began working on this new feature. It's a little disorganised and needs to be checked errors and type safety. Also, refactor it to be modular and follow conventional code design principles. Move any repetitive or misplaced code into dedicated subfolders in the specific feature directory such as data-explorer/{constants, hooks, components, api}.
