## Issue #33

Please review the GitHub issue number \"#33\" in my repository for this codebase named (rathburn-online); the issue is named \"Comprehensive Spreadsheet-style Data Explorer & Modular Query Builder\". You will be working on the feature 'data-explorer', which you can find the code for in \"/src/features/data-explorer\". The code is in development as I just began working on this new feature. It's a little disorganised and needs to be checked errors and type safety. Also, refactor it to be modular and follow conventional code design principles. Move any repetitive or misplaced code into dedicated subfolders in the specific feature directory such as data-explorer/{constants, hooks, components, api}.

Please review the GitHub issue number \"#33\" in my repository for this codebase named (rathburn-online). The issue is named "Comprehensive Spreadsheet-style │
│ Data Explorer & Modular Query Builder". You will be working on the feature 'data-explorer', which you can find the code for in │
│ \"/src/features/data-explorer\". Do not write any code in the existing files in the application layer (...:3000/data-explorer nextJS page route), or the │
│ related features files. What I would like you to do is ensure we can demonstrate a working minimum viable product version of this feature. So that means: no │
│ fancy UI yet, don't focus on performance enhancements, but instead just make sure it works. Please read the project workflow guidelines written in │
│ "./cursor/rules/feature-workflow.mdc" for the preferred workflow steps to follow. Go through the 10 sections, and answer the questions for this specific │
│ feature. You don't have to literally write answers, but do work under the guide as a reference. Start off with viewing relevant files debugging
