# Turborepo Setup

1. **Shared Backend & Database**

- Having both apps use the same backend and database is absolutely feasible and actually quite common
- Since you're already using a separate schema ('mobile') for the mobile-specific functionality, you have good separation of concerns while maintaining data consistency
- The NextJS API routes can serve both applications effectively

2. **Benefits of Turborepo in Your Case**

- **Shared Code**: You can create a shared package for:
  - API client code/types
  - Authentication logic
  - Common UI components
  - Utility functions
  - Type definitions for your database schemas
- **Consistent Development Experience**:
  - Single source of truth for dependencies
  - Unified testing and deployment pipelines
  - Easier to maintain consistent coding standards
- **Efficient Development**:
  - Turborepo's caching can speed up builds
  - Parallel execution of tasks across apps
  - Single place to manage dependencies

3. **Vite + Next.js Compatibility**
   The different frameworks actually don't pose a significant challenge in a Turborepo setup. Here's a typical structure you might use:

```
apps/
  ├── web/                 # Your existing Next.js app
  │   ├── package.json
  │   └── ...
  └── mobile/             # Your new Vite app
      ├── package.json
      └── ...
packages/
  ├── ui/                 # Shared UI components
  │   ├── package.json
  │   └── ...
  ├── api-client/         # Shared API client code
  │   ├── package.json
  │   └── ...
  └── types/             # Shared TypeScript types
      ├── package.json
      └── ...
```

4. **Recommendations for Implementation**

- Use `pnpm` or `yarn` workspaces for package management
- Create a shared `tsconfig.json` base
- Implement shared ESLint and Prettier configs
- Set up a shared build pipeline that respects each framework's requirements

5. **Potential Challenges to Consider**

- Initial setup time for the monorepo structure
- Need to carefully manage shared dependencies
- May need to adjust CI/CD pipelines
- Different build processes for Next.js and Vite

6. **Why It's Worth It**

- Easier code sharing between apps
- Single place for documentation
- Simplified dependency management
- Easier to maintain consistency
- Better visibility across the entire project
- Simplified deployment processes

The fact that you have:

- Same user base
- Shared backend
- Shared database
- Related functionality
- Need for code reuse

Makes this an ideal case for a monorepo, even with the different frameworks.

Would you like me to provide more specific details about any aspect of the implementation, such as:

1. Example Turborepo configuration
2. Shared package structure
3. Build pipeline setup
4. API client implementation strategy

Let me know what aspects you'd like to explore further!
