# Product Requirements Document (PRD)

**Feature:** Gamification & Engagement Layer for Progressive Web App

---

## 1. Purpose & Background

The existing PWA supports raw‑material inventory and production‑order workflows via barcode/QR scanning. To boost user engagement, ensure SOP compliance, and reduce negligence, we will introduce a gamification layer that rewards, recognizes, and tracks operator performance over time.

## 2. Goals & Success Metrics

| Goal                                           | Metric                                              |
| ---------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------- |
| **Increase scan compliance**                   |  +20% scan events recorded per shift in first month |
| **Raise daily active users of PWA**            |  +15% DAU within 4 weeks of launch                  |
| **Improve time‑to‑complete context+drum scan** |  –10% average scan cycle time                       |
| **Foster healthy competition**                 |  At least 50% of users reach first milestone badge  |
| **Gather user feedback on gamification UX**    |  >75% positive survey responses after MVP rollout   |

## 3. Scope & Phasing

### 3.1 In‑Scope (MVP PWA)

* **Light Gamification Elements**

  * Milestone **Badges**: Award for first scan, 10 scans, 50 scans.
  * **Progress Bar**: Visible on user’s profile page showing next badge threshold.
  * **Statistics Dashboard**: Simple “Your Scans Today” and “Total Scans” counters.
* **Core Scanning and Record Views** (already built)

  * Context‑scan wizard (“Scan location → Scan drum”).
  * Recent scans list on dashboard.
* **Onboarding Tutorial** (static)

  * 3‑step pop‑up guiding through scanning workflow.

### 3.2 Out‑of‑Scope (Future Phases)

* Full **XP & Prestige Level** system
* **Achievements Catalog** with dynamic milestones
* **“Material Collector”** (Pokédex‑style) page
* **Leaderboards** (weekly & all‑time, top‑N)
* **Ranked/ELO** performance ratings
* Social features (team challenges, badges sharing)

---

## 4. Stakeholders

* **Product Owner:** Defines feature priorities, accepts deliverables.
* **Engineering:** Implements UI, backend, analytics.
* **UX/UI Designer:** Creates wireframes, visual assets.
* **Operations Manager:** Defines valid scan events and SOP thresholds.
* **QA:** Validates functionality and performance.
* **End Users (Operators):** Provide feedback in pilot.

---

## 5. Functional Requirements

### 5.1 MVP Gamification

1. **Badge Engine**

   * Award badges when user hits scan thresholds:

     * *First Scan* (1), *Getting Started* (10), *Committed* (50).
   * Store badge unlock date in user profile.
2. **Progress Indicator**

   * On “My Profile” page show a linear progress bar:

     * Current scans vs. next badge target.
3. **Statistics Dashboard**

   * On app dashboard show:

     * *Scans Today* (resets at 00:00 local time).
     * *Total Scans* (lifetime).
4. **Onboarding Tutorial**

   * Modal with 3 slides: scan station QR, scan drum, view record.
   * Display only on first login; allow manual replay from settings.

### 5.2 Data & Analytics

* Persist every scan with `user_id`, `timestamp`, `scan_type`.
* Aggregate daily and lifetime counts in a new `user_stats` table.
* Expose REST endpoints

  * `GET /api/user/stats` → `{ todayCount, totalCount, nextBadgeThreshold }`
  * `POST /api/user/badge-unlock` (internal)

### 5.3 Notifications & Feedback

* **Toast** on badge unlock (“Congratulations! You earned the ‘Getting Started’ badge.”)
* **Badge Showcase** in profile, with hover tooltip for unlock date.

---

## 6. Non‑Functional Requirements

* **PWA Compliance**: offline caching of static assets and user stats.
* **Performance**: badge logic must not exceed 50 ms on the client.
* **Accessibility**: progress bar and badges must include ARIA labels.
* **Security**: endpoints require authenticated JWT; rate‑limit stats queries to 5 req/min.
* **Scalability**: design `user_stats` and `badges` tables to handle 1 M users.

## 7. User Stories & Acceptance Criteria

| ID  | User Story                                                                                        | Acceptance Criteria                                                                                                               |
| --- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| US1 | As an operator, I want to see my daily and total scan counts so that I understand my progress.    | - Dashboard displays today’s scans and lifetime scans.<br>- Values update immediately after each successful scan.                 |
| US2 | As an operator, I want to earn badges when I hit scan milestones so that I feel rewarded.         | - After the 10th scan, user receives “Getting Started” badge.<br>- A toast appears, badge is visible in profile with unlock date. |
| US3 | As a new user, I want a quick tutorial so that I know how to use the scanning workflow correctly. | - On first login, a modal with three instructional slides appears.<br>- User can skip or replay tutorial later via Settings.      |
| US4 | As a manager, I want to track overall badge adoption rates so I can measure engagement.           | - Admin dashboard shows % of users with at least one badge.<br>- Data refreshes daily.                                            |

---

## 8. Success Metrics & Monitoring

* **Adoption**: % of active users earning ≥1 badge in first two weeks.
* **Engagement**: average scans/day/user before vs. after launch.
* **Performance**: time to render dashboard ≤200 ms.
* **Reliability**: error‑rate on `/api/user/stats` <0.5%.
* **Feedback**: post‑MVP survey with ≥75% positive sentiment on gamification.
