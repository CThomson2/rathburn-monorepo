# Barcode Scanning System - Technical Overview

## Introduction

This document provides a comprehensive overview of the industrial-grade barcode scanning system implementation for processing data from Honeywell CT47 and CK67 scanners. The system is built using Next.js, TypeScript, and Supabase, following best practices for robust API design, data validation, error handling, and monitoring.

The system is built using a modular, service-oriented architecture that separates concerns and utilizes two distinct applications within this monorepo:

1. **Mobile App (Vite)**

   - UI components in `apps/mobile/src/features/transport/ScanInput.tsx` and `apps/mobile/src/components/ScanHandler.tsx` capture barcode scans
   - Backend services in `apps/mobile/src/services/scanner/handle-scan.ts` construct and send CORS-permitted HTTP requests to the Next.js backend
   - Real-time SSE subscriptions established via Supabase client in `apps/mobile/src/services/scanner/handle-scan.ts`

2. **Web App (Next.js)**

   - Next.js App Router lives under `apps/web/src/app` with API route handlers in `apps/web/src/app/api/scanner/.../route.ts` and server actions
   - Validation schemas in `apps/web/src/lib/validation/index.ts` and Supabase client setup in `apps/web/src/lib/supabase/client.ts`
   - Processes incoming scan requests, inserts records into Supabase table `logs.drum_scan`, and returns structured responses

3. **Data Layer**

   - Shared database schemas and migrations managed via Supabase
   - Real-time triggers and functions on `logs.drum_scan` handle context application, detection, and location updates

4. **Monitoring Layer**

   - Health checks
   - Performance metrics
   - Logging
   - Error reporting

5. **Web Interface**
   - Simple UI for testing and administration
   - Scan history viewing
   - Real-time scan processing

## Key Components

### API Endpoints

The API provides these main endpoints:

- `POST /api/barcode` - Process a single barcode scan
- `POST /api/barcode/batch` - Process multiple scans at once
- `GET /api/barcode/lookup` - Look up scan details by scan_id
- `GET /api/health` - Check system health status
- `GET /api/metrics` - Get system performance metrics

### Authentication

Authentication is handled via API keys specific to each scanner device. Each scanner has:

- A unique identifier (`scanner_id`)
- An API key for authentication
- Permissions for specific locations and scan types
- Configuration loaded from environment variables or database

### Data Validation

Data validation is implemented using the Zod library, providing:

- Type-safe schema validation
- Clear error messages for invalid data
- Required field enforcement
- Data type conversion and normalization

### Database Schema

The primary database tables include:

- `log_drum_scan` - Stores all scan records with unique scan_id constraint
- `migration_history` - Tracks applied database migrations
- Additional indexes for performance optimization

### Core Services

The system includes these key services:

1. **Scan Service** (`scanService`)

   - Processes individual and batch scan requests
   - Handles different scan types (inventory, receiving, shipping)
   - Prevents duplicate scans
   - Applies business rules

2. **Notification Service** (`notificationService`)

   - Sends alerts for successful scans
   - Notifies about batch processing results
   - Reports errors and anomalies
   - Supports email and SMS notifications (mock implementations)

3. **Health Monitor** (`healthMonitor`)
   - Tracks system performance metrics
   - Performs health checks
   - Records request success/failure rates
   - Monitors response times

### Structured Logging

The system features a robust logging system that:

- Formats logs in JSON for easier parsing
- Includes context and timestamps
- Supports different log levels (debug, info, warn, error)
- Records relevant details for troubleshooting

### Error Handling

Error handling is standardized across the system with:

- Consistent error response format
- Specific error types for different scenarios
- Detailed error logging
- Clear user-facing error messages

### Environment Configuration

Environment variables are managed through a central configuration manager that:

- Validates required environment variables
- Provides sensible defaults when appropriate
- Handles type conversion
- Centralizes configuration access

### Database Migrations

The system includes tools for database schema management:

- SQL migration files
- Migration tracking in database
- Migration application utilities
- Scripts for running migrations

### CORS and Security

Security measures include:

- CORS configuration via middleware
- HTTP security headers
- API key authentication
- Scanner permissions validation

### Request Flow

The typical flow for processing a single barcode scan is as follows:

1. **User scans a barcode** in the mobile app UI:
   - `ScanInput` component (`apps/mobile/src/features/transport/ScanInput.tsx`) captures the raw barcode string.
2. **ScanHandler processes the input**:
   - `ScanHandler` component (`apps/mobile/src/components/ScanHandler.tsx`) receives the barcode via `onScan`.
   - Calls `scanService.handleSingleScan` in `apps/mobile/src/services/scanner/handle-scan.ts` with `{ barcode, jobId, mode: 'single', authToken, deviceId }`.
3. **ScanService makes an HTTP request**:
   - Constructs a POST request to `${import.meta.env.VITE_API_URL}/api/scanner/scan/drum/scan/single`.
4. **Next.js API route handles the request**:
   - API handler in `apps/web/src/app/api/scanner/scan/single/route.ts` authenticates the token, validates the request using Zod schemas in `src/lib/validation/index.ts`, and inserts a new record into `logs.drum_scan` via Supabase client in `src/lib/supabase/client.ts`.
5. **Backend response**:
   - The API returns `{ scan_id, drum }` structured as `ScanProcessingResponse`.
6. **Mobile UI updates**:
   - `scanService.handleSingleScan` resolves with a `ScanResult` object.
   - `ScanHandler` displays success or error toasts based on the result.
7. **Real-time events**:
   - `setupScanEventSource` in `apps/mobile/src/services/scanner/handle-scan.ts` subscribes to Postgres change events on `logs.drum_scan`.
   - Incoming events (scan_success, scan_error) trigger UI notifications for remote or delayed scans.

### Error Handling Flow

When an error occurs:

1. Error is caught in the API route handler
2. Specific error types are identified (validation, duplicate, database, etc.)
3. Error is logged with context information
4. Health monitor records the failure
5. Notification service sends error alert if configured
6. API returns standardized error response with appropriate HTTP status code

### Batch Processing

The batch processing flow:

1. Multiple scans are received in a single request
2. Each scan is validated individually
3. Scans are processed in sequence
4. Results are tracked for successful and failed scans
5. All results are returned in a single response
6. Partial success returns HTTP 207 Multi-Status code
