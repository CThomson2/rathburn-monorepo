# Rathburn Documentation Portal - Progress Summary

## Accomplishments

### 1. Project Setup

- ✅ Created initial Docusaurus project structure
- ✅ Identified challenges with Docusaurus implementation
- ✅ Created alternative implementation plan using Next.js

### 2. File Tree Component

- ✅ Implemented file tree component based on Radix UI Accordion
- ✅ Created support components (Button, ScrollArea)
- ✅ Implemented utility functions for the component
- ✅ Created demo structure showing documentation categories

### 3. Documentation Organization

- ✅ Created script to find all markdown files in the monorepo
- ✅ Designed categorization strategy for documentation
- ✅ Implemented logic to prepare files for the documentation site

### 4. Project Planning

- ✅ Updated README with detailed project plan
- ✅ Created roadmap for implementation
- ✅ Documented file organization structure

## Next Steps

### 1. Platform Decision

- [ ] Decide between Docusaurus (with fixes) or Next.js
- [ ] If using Next.js, create new app structure using existing monorepo patterns

### 2. Content Migration

- [ ] Finalize the categorization of existing markdown files
- [ ] Run the migration script to prepare documentation files
- [ ] Add proper front matter and navigation structure

### 3. UI Implementation

- [ ] Complete file tree navigation implementation
- [ ] Implement search functionality
- [ ] Create category landing pages
- [ ] Ensure responsive design across devices

### 4. Deployment

- [ ] Set up CI/CD pipeline for documentation updates
- [ ] Configure automatic builds on documentation changes
- [ ] Deploy to production environment

## Technical Decisions

### File Tree Component

The file tree component has been implemented with the following features:

- Hierarchical navigation of the documentation structure
- Visual indicators for folders and files
- Expand/collapse functionality for directories
- Selection of files with visual feedback
- RTL support for internationalization

### Content Organization

The documentation is organized into the following categories:

- **User Guides**: End-user documentation
- **Development**: Developer documentation (components, APIs, hooks)
- **Architecture**: System architecture documentation
- **Deployment**: Deployment and infrastructure documentation

### Migration Strategy

The migration script implements the following workflow:

1. Scan the monorepo for all markdown files
2. Categorize files based on content and location
3. Create appropriate directory structure in the documentation site
4. Add front matter for proper navigation
5. Copy files to their respective locations

## Recommendation

Based on the implementation challenges and the existing monorepo structure, we recommend:

1. **Migrate to Next.js**: Use Next.js for the documentation site to ensure compatibility with the rest of the monorepo
2. **Keep the File Tree Component**: Reuse the implemented file tree component with necessary adjustments
3. **Adapt the Migration Script**: Update the script to work with Next.js documentation structure
4. **Leverage Monorepo Patterns**: Use the existing UI components and patterns from the monorepo

This approach will provide a more consistent development experience and allow for better integration with the existing codebase.
