# Feature v.1.2.1 - QRD Form Enhancements & Repro Drum Management

## 🎯 **Project Summary: Drum Inventory Management System Fixes**

### **Issues Resolved**

#### **1. Download Label Button Fix** ✅

- **Problem**: `inventory-grid.tsx` was calling API directly instead of using proper label generation
- **Solution**:
  - Created new API endpoint: `/api/barcodes/single-drum-label/[drum-id]/route.ts`
  - Updated `handleDownloadLabel` function to use new endpoint
  - Now generates individual drum PDFs instead of batch PDFs

#### **2. Assign to Production Run Fix** ✅

- **Problem**: Both web and mobile apps had broken drum assignment functionality
- **Solution**:
  - Created new database function: `assign_drum_to_production_job`
  - Created wrapper function: `assign_drum_by_serial_number` for mobile scanning
  - Updated web app to use proper RPC calls instead of outdated `create_transport_task`
  - Simplified mobile app logic to use new database functions

### **Database Improvements** 🗄️

**New RPC Functions Created:**

1. **`assign_drum_to_production_job`**:

   - Validates drum status (must be `in_stock`)
   - Matches drum's batch to job's input batch
   - Prevents duplicate assignments
   - Returns success/failure with detailed messaging

2. **`assign_drum_by_serial_number`**:
   - Mobile-optimized wrapper for scanning workflow
   - Handles serial number lookup and validation
   - Maintains same validation logic as main function

### **Web App Fixes** 🌐

**File: `apps/web/src/features/drum-index/components/inventory-grid.tsx`**

- [x] Fixed `handleAssignToProductionRun` to use new RPC function
- [x] Fixed `handleDownloadLabel` to use single drum API endpoint
- [x] Improved error handling and user feedback with proper toast messages
- [x] Removed duplicate `.schema()` call that was causing errors

**New API Route Created:**

- [x] `/api/barcodes/single-drum-label/[drum-id]/route.ts` for individual drum label generation

### **Mobile App Fixes** 📱

**File: `apps/mobile/src/core/stores/session-store.ts`**

- [x] Replaced complex manual assignment logic in `processScan` function
- [x] Now uses `assign_drum_by_serial_number` RPC call
- [x] Simplified error handling while maintaining state management
- [x] Proper integration with existing counter updates and UI feedback

### **Technical Benefits** 🚀

1. **Robust Validation**: All drum assignment logic now centralized in database functions
2. **Better Error Handling**: Detailed error messages and proper status codes
3. **Simplified Codebase**: Removed duplicate logic between web and mobile
4. **Proper Status Transitions**: Enforces business rules (in_stock → reserved → in_production)
5. **Prevent Duplicate Assignments**: Database-level protection against double assignments

### **Business Logic Improvements** 💼

- **Drum Status Validation**: Only `in_stock` drums can be assigned
- **Batch Matching**: Drums must belong to the job's input batch
- **Existing Job Assignment**: Assigns to existing scheduled jobs instead of creating new ones
- **Audit Trail**: Proper tracking of who assigned drums and when

### **Current Status** ✅

- [x] Web app label download working with new API endpoint
- [x] Web app production assignment using proper database functions
- [x] Mobile app drum scanning simplified and using RPC calls
- [x] Database functions handle all validation and business logic
- [x] Proper error handling and user feedback throughout
- [x] Minor linting issues resolved (ARIA attributes, Tailwind config)

### **Key Files Modified** 📝

1. **Database**: New RPC functions in production schema
2. **Web**: `inventory-grid.tsx` + new API route
3. **Mobile**: `session-store.ts` scanning logic
4. **Config**: Fixed Tailwind config syntax errors

The drum inventory management system now has robust, centralized business logic with proper validation, error handling, and a much cleaner codebase architecture! 🎉
